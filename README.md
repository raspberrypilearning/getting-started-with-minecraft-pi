# Getting Started with Programming the Minecraft World

![](cover.png)

Minecraft is a popular sandbox open world building game. A free version of Minecraft is available for the Raspberry Pi; it also comes with a programming interface. This means you can write commands and scripts in Python code to build things in the game automatically. It's a great way to learn Python!
