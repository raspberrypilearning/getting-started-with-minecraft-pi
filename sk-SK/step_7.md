## Playing with TNT blocks

Another interesting block is TNT! To place a normal TNT block use:

```python
tnt = 46
mc.setBlock(x, y, z, tnt)
```

However, this TNT block is fairly boring. Try applying `data` as `1`:

```python
tnt = 46
mc.setBlock(x, y, z, tnt, 1)
```

Now use your sword and left click the TNT block: it will be activated and will explode in a matter of seconds!

Now try making a big cube of TNT blocks!

```python
tnt = 46
mc.setBlocks(x+1, y+1, z+1, x+11, y+11, z+11, tnt, 1)
```

Now you'll see a big cube full of TNT blocks. Go and activate one of the blocks and then run away to watch the show! It'll be really slow to render the graphics as so many things are changing at once.
