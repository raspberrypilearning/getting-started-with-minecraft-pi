## What you will need

### Software

#### Software installation

Minecraft has been installed by default in Raspbian since September 2014.

If you're using an older version of Raspbian, open a terminal window and type the following commands (you must be online):

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install minecraft-pi
```

Once that finishes, Minecraft Pi and the Python library should be installed.

#### Test Minecraft

To run Minecraft double click the desktop icon or enter `minecraft-pi` in the terminal.

When Minecraft Pi has loaded, click on **Start Game**, followed by **Create new**. You'll notice that the containing window is offset slightly. This means to drag the window around you have to grab the title bar behind the Minecraft window.

You are now in a game of Minecraft!

#### Test Python

With Minecraft running, and the world created, bring your focus away from the game by pressing the `Tab` key, which will free your mouse. Open IDLE (not IDLE3) on the Desktop and move the windows so they're side-by-side.

You can either type commands directly in to the Python window or create a file so you can save your code and run it again another time.

If you want create a file go to `File > New window` and `File > Save`. You'll probably want to save this in your home folder or a new project folder.

Start by importing the Minecraft library, creating a connection to the game and testing it by posting the message "Hello world" to the screen:

```python
from mcpi import minecraft

mc = minecraft.Minecraft.create()

mc.postToChat("Hello world")
```

If you're entering commands directly in to the Python window, just hit `Enter` after each line. If it's a file, save with `Ctrl + S` and run with `F5`. When your code runs, you should see your message on screen in the game.

If you see "Hello world" in the Minecraft window, you're good to proceed to the next step.
