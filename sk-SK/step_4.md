When Minecraft Pi has loaded, click on **Start Game**, followed by **Create new**. You'll notice that the containing window is offset slightly. This means to drag the window around you have to grab the title bar behind the Minecraft window.

You are now in a game of Minecraft! Go walk around, hack things, and build things!

Use the mouse to look around and use the following keys on the keyboard:

|     Key      |        Action        |
|:------------:|:--------------------:|
|      W       |       Forward        |
|      A       |         Left         |
|      S       |       Backward       |
|      D       |        Right         |
|      E       |      Inventory       |
|    Space     |         Jump         |
| Double Space |      Fly / Fall      |
|     Esc      |  Pause / Game menu   |
|     Tab      | Release mouse cursor |

You can select an item from the quick draw panel with the mouse's scroll wheel (or use the numbers on your keyboard), or press `E` and select something from the inventory.

You can also double tap the space bar to fly into the air. You'll stop flying when you release the space bar, and if you double tap it again you'll fall back to the ground.

With the sword in your hand, you can click on blocks in front of you to remove them (or to dig). With a block in your hand, you can use right click to place that block in front of you, or left click to remove a block.
