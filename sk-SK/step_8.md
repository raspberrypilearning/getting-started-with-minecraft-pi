## Fun with flowing lava.

One block that's a lot of fun to play with is flowing lava.

```python
from mcpi.minecraft import Minecraft

mc = Minecraft.create()

x, y, z = mc.player.getPos()

lava = 10

mc.setBlock(x+3, y+3, z, lava)
```

Find the block you've just placed, and you should see lava flowing from the block to the ground.

The cool thing about lava is that when it cools down it becomes rock. Move to another location in your world and try this:

```python
from mcpi.minecraft import Minecraft
from time import sleep

mc = Minecraft.create()

x, y, z = mc.player.getPos()

lava = 10
water = 8
air = 0

mc.setBlock(x+3, y+3, z, lava)
sleep(20)
mc.setBlock(x+3,y+5, z, water)
sleep(4)
mc.setBlock(x+3, y+5, z, air)

```

You can adjust the `sleep` parameters to allow more or less lava to flow.
